infoClass is a school work managing web app written in PHP.
If you want to see demo go to infoclass.rf.gd

Some of the features are making profile, creating classrooms, class chat, noting test and homework dates...

Its made using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5, PHP, MySQL.

It was made as practice project while learning PHP, so its mess and I never revorked it.
